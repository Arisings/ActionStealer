# ActionStealer
Minecraft ChatTriggers modules that scans for action items held by other players. Useful for housings where you have creative, such as FreeBuilds, to steal staff items.

## Usage
Whenever a player holds an action item, a chat message will pop up notifying you along with various buttons to view the actions of the items, give yourself the item, and copy the NBT data. You can configure the logger to only be active when you are in creative or on a Free Build house to prevent unnecessary spam on public housings.
